With HTTP/S and WebSocket support, your user/client can interact with the localhost site, as if its hosted on cloud. \r\n\r\n#### Local directory shared over internet.\r\n\r\nIf you just want to share a directory with others, you just have to start Gotunnel with a few command line options (no need to run another server).\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\nYou have to be online, and running the server and Gotunnel, for the site to be accessible :)\r\nSpeed. Its going to be slower than a hosted system.","google":"UA-40958868-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
